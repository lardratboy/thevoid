The Void - circa 2001

Quick and dirty tool used to capture a top level window of a running process and make it 
a child of the void.  When the void is minimized it hides whatever it is containing as well.
to get back to the voided apps double right click on the icon in the tray area.

This was built using visual studio 6 (or 7) which I don't have installed so I can't tell you if this is in a compiling state in any modern compiler.
